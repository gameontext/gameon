The **Game On! Community Slack** should be a safe place for everybody regardless of

- gender, gender identity or gender expression 
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- race
- age
- religion

As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), 
  eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - 
  this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
* We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.


We actively work towards:

* Being a safe community
* Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other
* Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression


We condemn:

* Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information
* Threats of harm
* Harassment of any form
* Anything that compromises people’s safety
* Solicitation

**These things are NOT OK.**

If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
* Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. Admins 
reserve the right to suspend any account if we receive a complaint(s).

**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let a moderator know. 
Here is a list of the current moderators and their Slack IDs:**

* Erin Schnabel - @ebullient

*The role of the moderators is to be an unbiased mediator, they will not moderate or edit 
anything written in the Slack unless it is required as a result of a discussed dispute.*

-- with thanks to the Ember Community (and on to the Front-end London Slack Community) for a starting place for guidelines.
